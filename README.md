# Deep Learning for Peak-Stress Prediction in Polycrystalline Materials

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project presents a deep learning approach to predict peak-stress clusters in heterogeneous polycrystalline materials. Unlike prior work that focused on overall stress fields, this method targets localized peak-stress regions critical to failure. Using a convolutional encoderâ€“decoder network trained on synthetic microstructures and linear elasticity simulations, the model predicts stress fields and identifies peak-stress clusters. Evaluation using cosine similarity and geometric comparisons shows high accuracy, especially for higher normalized stress values.

### âœ… Key Features

- Rapid identification of optimal deposition parameters
- Improved consistency and reproducibility of thin film properties
- Reduced experimental effort

Our results confirm that Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for thin film process development, delivering high-performance films with controlled stress and resistance characteristics.
